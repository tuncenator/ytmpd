2. Read `docs/agent/mpd-integration/QUICKSTART.md` for orientation
3. Read `docs/agent/mpd-integration/PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Phase 1 section ONLY
4. This is the first phase - no previous summaries to read
5. Complete the phase following the completion criteria
6. Create `docs/agent/mpd-integration/summaries/PHASE_01_SUMMARY.md`
7. Update this file:
   - Mark Phase 1 as ‚úÖ Complete
   - Set Phase 2 as üîµ CURRENT
   - Update "Current Phase" to "2 of 8"
   - Update "Phase Name" to "MPD Client Module"
   - Update "Progress" to "12% (1/8 phases complete)"
   - Update progress bar: `[‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë] 12% (1/8)`
   - Update "Last Updated" to completion date

### For Subsequent Phases

1. **ALWAYS start by running `pwd`** to verify location
2. Read the 2 most recent phase summaries from `docs/agent/mpd-integration/summaries/`
3. Read your phase section in `docs/agent/mpd-integration/PROJECT_PLAN.md`
4. Complete your phase
5. Create your phase summary

## Notes

### Architecture Overview

Transforming ytmpd from standalone daemon to MPD sync service:

**New Flow:**
```
YouTube Music Playlists
         ‚Üì
    ytmpd sync daemon
         ‚Üì
    MPD (local Unix socket)
         ‚Üì
    mpc commands (existing i3 keybindings)
```

### Key Design Decisions

- Prefix YouTube playlists with "YT: " in MPD
- Support both periodic auto-sync and manual sync
- Local MPD only (Unix socket, no auth)
- Fully migrate to MPD protocol (remove custom socket server)
- Stream URLs cached for 5 hours (YouTube expiry ~6 hours)

### Phase Dependencies

- Phases 2, 3, 4 can be worked in parallel after Phase 1
- Phase 5 requires Phases 2, 3, 4
- Phases 6, 7, 8 are sequential

### Blockers

None currently.
