# Phase [NUMBER]: [PHASE NAME] - Summary

**Date Completed:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Completed By:** [Agent Session ID or identifier if available]
**Actual Token Usage:** ~XXk tokens

---

## Objective

[Copy the objective from PROJECT_PLAN.md]

---

## Work Completed

### What Was Built

[Describe what was implemented in this phase. Be specific but concise.]

Example:
- Implemented `csv_processor.py` with 4 main functions
- Created filtering logic for tier and priority
- Added CSV schema validation
- Built URI grouping functionality

### Files Created

- `path/to/file1.py` - [Brief description]
- `path/to/file2.yaml` - [Brief description]

### Files Modified

- `path/to/existing.py` - [What changed and why]

### Key Design Decisions

[Explain any important choices made during implementation]

Example:
- Used pandas for CSV processing instead of csv module for better performance
- Chose to validate schema before filtering to fail fast on invalid input
- Implemented grouping as dict[str, DataFrame] for easy lookup by URI

---

## Completion Criteria Status

[Copy the completion criteria checklist from PROJECT_PLAN.md and mark each item]

- [x] Criterion 1 - Completed successfully
- [x] Criterion 2 - Completed successfully
- [x] Criterion 3 - Completed with minor deviation (explain below)
- [ ] Criterion 4 - NOT completed (explain below)

### Deviations / Incomplete Items

[If any criteria were not met or implementation differs from plan, explain here]

Example:
- Criterion 4 was not completed because [reason]. This will need to be addressed in Phase X.
- Modified approach for Criterion 3: instead of [planned approach], used [actual approach] because [reason].

---

## Testing

### Tests Written

[List test files/functions created]

Example:
- `tests/test_csv_processor.py`
  - test_load_primat_csv()
  - test_apply_hard_filters()
  - test_validate_csv_schema()

### Test Results

```
[Paste test output or summary]

Example:
$ pytest tests/test_csv_processor.py
===== 8 passed in 1.23s =====
```

### Manual Testing

[Describe any manual testing performed]

Example:
- Tested with CMI_202506-Primat Actions Csv.csv (22,681 rows)
- Filtering reduced to 5,420 rows (tier=1, priority=HIGH)
- Validated output schema matches input

---

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: [Brief description]
**Solution:** [How it was resolved]

### Challenge 2: [Brief description]
**Solution:** [How it was resolved]

[If no challenges, state: "No significant challenges encountered."]

---

## Code Quality

### Formatting
- [ ] Code formatted with black
- [ ] Imports organized
- [ ] No unused imports

### Documentation
- [ ] All functions have docstrings
- [ ] Type hints added where appropriate
- [ ] Module-level docstring present

### Linting
```
[Paste pylint or flake8 output if run]

Example:
$ pylint src/primat/csv_processor.py
Your code has been rated at 9.2/10
```

---

## Dependencies

### Required by This Phase
[List phases that had to be complete before this one]

Example:
- Phase 1: Project structure
- Phase 2: Configuration system

### Unblocked Phases
[List phases that can now proceed because this one is complete]

Example:
- Phase 7: Fresh Mode - Filter Pipeline (can now use csv_processor)
- Phase 11: Comparison Mode - Existence Checker (can now use csv_processor)

---

## Notes for Future Phases

[Any important information, warnings, or suggestions for agents working on future phases]

Example:
- The grouping function returns a dict, not a list. Phase 9 will need to iterate over .items()
- CSV validation is strict - may need to relax for edge cases in production
- Consider adding progress bars in Phase 10 when processing large datasets

---

## Integration Points

[How this phase's code integrates with other components]

Example:
- `csv_processor.load_primat_csv()` is called by both fresh_mode.py and compare_mode.py
- Filter configuration comes from config.py (Phase 2)
- Returns pandas DataFrame that will be consumed by ai_batch_processor.py (Phase 4)

---

## Performance Notes

[Any performance observations or concerns]

Example:
- Loading 22k row CSV takes ~0.5 seconds
- Filtering is near-instant with pandas
- Grouping by URI takes ~0.1 seconds
- Memory usage: ~50MB for full dataset

---

## Known Issues / Technical Debt

[Document any shortcuts, TODOs, or issues that need future attention]

Example:
- TODO: Add progress bar for large CSV files
- Warning: No handling for duplicate rows in CSV (assuming input is clean)
- Consider: Could optimize grouping if datasets exceed 100k rows

---

## Security Considerations

[Any security-relevant aspects of this phase]

Example:
- CSV loading uses pandas, which is safe from CSV injection
- No user input validation needed at this layer (CLI handles paths)
- No sensitive data processed in this phase

---

## Next Steps

**Next Phase:** [Number and Name]

**Recommended Actions:**
1. [What should be done next]
2. [Any prep work for next phase]

Example:
1. Proceed to Phase 4: Gemini Integration - Batch Processor
2. Ensure GEMINI_API_KEY is set in environment
3. Review Gemini API documentation for rate limits

---

## Approval

**Phase Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

[Or if incomplete:]
**Phase Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETE - [reason]
**Blockers:** [What needs to happen before marking complete]

## Appendix

### Example Usage

[If applicable, show how to use the code from this phase]

```python
# Example
from primat.config import load_config
from primat.csv_processor import load_primat_csv, apply_hard_filters

config = load_config('config/config.yaml')
df = load_primat_csv('input.csv')
filtered = apply_hard_filters(df, config)
print(f"Filtered to {len(filtered)} issues")
```

Example:
- Pandas filtering docs: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/indexing.html
- Project config schema: see config/config.yaml.example
