## Instructions for Agents

### Current Phase: Phase 7

1. **Verify location**: `pwd` → `/home/tunc/Sync/Programs/ytmpd`
2. **Verify git branch**: `git branch` → `* feature/i3blocks-status`
3. **Activate environment**: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Read `PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Phase 7 section only
5. Read Phase 6 summary: `summaries/PHASE_06_SUMMARY.md`
6. Complete the phase following the completion criteria
7. Create `summaries/PHASE_07_SUMMARY.md`
8. Update this file:
   - Mark Phase 7 as ✅ Complete
   - Update "Current Phase" to "7 of 7 (COMPLETE)"
   - Update "Progress" to "100% (7/7 phases complete)"
   - Update progress bar: `[████████████████████] 100% (7/7)`
9. **Stage changes**: `git add -A && git status`
10. **WAIT for user confirmation before committing**
11. Commit with clean message (no AI/Claude references)

**Full details:** See `PROJECT_PLAN.md` Phase 7
